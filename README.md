# Ariel – CISCO Network Malicious Traffic Detection Challenge

2021 (Based on the M.Sc. work of Ofek Bader and Adi Lichy)

## Description:
In this challenge, our task was to predict and classify malicious and benign network traffic by
utilizing our knowledge in data exploration and machine learning models.<br>
In this challenge, will had access to two <b>datasets</b>:
1. MTA – Malware samples from: https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/
2. USTC – Malware samples from: https://github.com/yungshenglu/USTC-TFC2016
3. Zero day dataset – will be provided in the last week of the competition.

For each dataset, we had two types of labels, hence two types of tasks:
1. Binary classification – Detect if the file is benign/malware ( 'label' column in the
data).
2. Multiclass classification – Detect the 'malware_family' – multiclass labeling including
benign.
Note: We only had labels for the Training part.

For each combination of dataset + task, we had two types of exercises/phases:
1. Validation – without labels
2. Test – without labels

## Features in the dataset:
The first 83 metadata features (columns) in the CSV files are identical to ones extracted by
the NFStream utility.<br> You can read about the features in the documentation of NFStream in
the section of 'NFlow' here: <br>
https://www.nfstream.org/docs/api.

## Additional features:
Feature names that start with 'udps', are additional features that were provided to us
from what NFStream has to offer.
1. <b>udps.n_bytes </b>- A 784 length list which contains the first 784 payload bytes of the
flow/session.
2. <b>udps.n_bytes_per_packet </b>- A (100,2) matrix, which contain the 100 first payload
bytes in the first 2 packets (non-empty payload packets) of the payload/flow.
3. <b>udps.protocol_header_fields</b> – A (32,4) matrix, [direction, payload size, delta_time,
tcp win size] of the first 32 packets. If the session Is not TCP-based, then the TCPwin-
size is set to 0.
4. <b>udps.stnn_image</b> – A (5,14) matrix, with statistical features about the flow/session.
1st row: bidirectional related data.
2nd row: src -> dst related data.
3rd row: third row: dst -> src related data.
4th row: handshake packets only related data.
5th row: data packets only related data.
Each row consists of 14 statistical features:
[ iat max, iat min, iat mean, iat stddev, iat skew,
size min, size max, size mean, size stddev, size skew,
#packets, #bytes, pkts/time, b y t e s / t i m e ]

### Where IAT = inter arrival time or delta time, size = packet payload size.
